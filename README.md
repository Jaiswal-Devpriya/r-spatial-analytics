# r-spatial-analytics
Reproducible R workflows for spatial and causal analysis of public U.S. socioeconomic datasets.

This repository documents my individual contribution to a team-based academic project completed as part of the course Foundations of Data Science Management (Fall 2025). The overall project evaluated the impact of the New Markets Tax Credit and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit programs on neighborhood-level social vulnerability and economic outcomes across multiple United States Census divisions. While the complete project, datasets, and final deliverables are hosted under a private university GitHub organization and published as a project website, this repository serves as a reference to my scoped analytical and software-oriented contributions.

My primary responsibility was the Mountain Division analysis, which involved writing R scripts for data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and analysis using public datasets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index, the United States Census Bureau American Community Survey, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. I conducted spatial analysis and visualization using choropleth maps and infographics, constructed Social Vulnerability Index themes, and implemented statistical workflows including correlation analysis, clustering, and Difference-in-Differences regression models to evaluate changes between 2010 and 2020. All analysis was developed in RStudio and versioned using GitHub Desktop, with commits reflecting iterative development and refinement.

In addition to division-specific work, the project was collaborative in nature. Each team member owned a separate Census division, while working together to integrate findings into a unified final deliverable. I contributed to the overall project structure, including the executive summary, data documentation, methodology description, R package listings, R version information, and reproducibility notes. The team collectively reviewed results and assembled the final project website, ensuring consistency across divisions while maintaining clear ownership of individual analytical sections.
